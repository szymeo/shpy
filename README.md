## Ideas

#### General

- champion spell cooldown guesser

#### Chadle

- show additional clue after 10 guesses
- show letters of champion name calculated logarithmically, e.g. 1 letter after 4 guesses, 2 letters after 16 guesses, etc.
- add species? (e.g. human, yordle, etc.) as a clue. Problematic because can't be automated.

## Drawle stages

1. Create or join the room with a room code, successful depending on the room state
2. Dedicated room view (depending on the viewer identity)

#### Round cycle

1. Random player drawing with a champion image
2. Other players guessing the champion name
3. Points are awarded to the drawer and the guesser, depending on the time taken to guess

#### Questions

1. Can room be paused?
2. Can player join a room in the middle of a game?
3. How to make people not figure out the scoring system and exploit it, e.g. by delaying the guess to deny the drawer points?
